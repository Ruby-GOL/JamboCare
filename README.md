# JamboCare - Language Translator Application

Welcome to the JamboCare GitHub repository! JamboCare is a translator app designed specifically to be used in translating language in primary healthcare settings, where communication
between healthcare professionals and patients is critical

## Structure

The repositories are structured as follows:

- [Backend](https://github.com/Ruby-GOL/Jambocare_backend): This repo contains the backend code of the JamboCare platform, including the API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in Python using Django and Django REST frameworks.
- [Frontend](https://github.com/Ruby-GOL/Jambo-care-frontend): Here, you will find the frontend code for the JamboCare platform, implemented using JavaScript, React, and Redux. This directory also includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for the development and improvement of the JamboCare platform. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.

## How Generative AI Models are Solving the Problem
JamboCare leverages Generative AI models to enhance the platform's functionality, particularly in the domain of language translation. The chosen Generative AI model, `facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M`, has been fine-tuned to process and interpret the transcribed text in multiple languages. This model utilizes cutting-edge techniques in natural language processing to generate accurate and meaningful translations for users.

By incorporating the `facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M` Generative AI model into JamboCare, we enable users to translate text between various languages effectively. Whether it's translating medical documents, patient records, or communication with non-English-speaking users, this model empowers JamboCare to provide high-quality language translation services. It opens up new possibilities for seamless communication and makes JamboCare a powerful platform for multilingual healthcare interactions.
